Having a little bit of fun.

![asciiworld](/asciiworld.png?raw=true)

Inspired by the world map in [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib).

Dependencies
============

You need a map. I suggest you use one of those:

*  [Natural Earth Data, Land](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/110m-land/)
*  [Natural Earth Data, Countries](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-admin-0-countries/)

Since NED distributes their data as "ESRI Shapefiles", you also need this library:

*  [Shapelib](http://shapelib.maptools.org/)

In Arch Linux, the library is available in the package [shapelib](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/shapelib/).

Command line options
====================

`-w W`, `-h H`: Force output size. By default, the full size of the terminal is used.

`-m path`: Path to an ESRI Shapefile (.shx or .shp).

`-l path`: Path to a file containing locations to highlight. For example, the following file would highlight Mainz and Cape Town:

    50 8
    -33.9 18.4

`-s`: Turn on "day-and-night" mode. Areas that are currently lit by the sun will be shown as yellow, whereas the other parts are shown as dark grey. The "position" of the sun itself will be marked with an "S".

`-T`: Do not print the final newline to avoid scrolling. Using `-sT`, you can show a continuously updated map in "day-and-night" mode:

    tput civis; while ./asciiworld -sT; do sleep 5; tput home; done

`-p proj`: Choose projection. By default, a trivial equirectanguar projection will be used. The following other projections are available:

*  `kav`: Kavrayskiy VII
*  `lam`: Lambert cylindrical equal-area
