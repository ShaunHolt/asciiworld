Having a little bit of fun.

![asciiworld](/asciiworld.png?raw=true)

Inspired by:

*  The world map in [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib)
*  Fancy stuff in [trehn's termtrack](https://github.com/trehn/termtrack)

Dependencies
============

You need a map. I suggest you use one of those:

*  [Natural Earth Data, Land](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/110m-land/)
*  [Natural Earth Data, Countries](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-admin-0-countries/)

Since NED distributes their data as "ESRI Shapefiles", you also need [shapelib](http://shapelib.maptools.org/).

For rendering filled polygons, [libgd](http://www.libgd.org/) is used.

Long story short: If you're using Arch Linux, you're fine with installing these two packages:

*  [gd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/gd/)
*  [shapelib](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/shapelib/)

Command line options
====================

`-w W`, `-h H`: Force output size. By default, the full size of the terminal is used.

`-m path`: Path to an ESRI Shapefile (.shx or .shp).

`-l path`: Path to a file containing locations and tracks to highlight. Points are preceeded by a line containing "points", tracks are preceeded by "track". Points are marked with an "X". Tracks are rendered using the common charset but all points on a track have the same distinct color. For example, the following file would highlight Mainz and Cape Town and render two arbitrary tracks:

    points
    50 8
    -33.9 18.4
    track
    50 8
    40 20
    30 40
    20 70
    10 90
    1 104
    track
    -33.9 18.4
    -40 30
    -50 50
    -60 80
    -50 110
    -40 130
    -33.9 151.1

Note that, for the time being, asciiworld draws tracks as points, too. To create the illusion of a connected line, you should simply provide enough points. :-)

`-s`: Turn on "day-and-night" mode. Areas that are currently lit by the sun will be shown as green, whereas the other parts are shown as dark dark blue. Areas currently in the "twilight zone" will be shaded accordingly (see `-d`). The "position" of the sun itself will be marked with an "S". A yellow line marks the current sunset/sunrise locations.

`-d dusk`: Choose definition of "dusk" and thus the twilight span. Accepts "nau" for nautical dusk (12 degree twilight) or "ast" for astronomical dusk (18 degree twilight). By default, civil dusk (6 degree twilight) is used.

`-T`: Do not print the final newline to avoid scrolling. Using `-sT`, you can show a continuously updated map in "day-and-night" mode:

    tput civis; while ./asciiworld -sT; do sleep 5; tput home; done

`-p proj`: Choose projection. By default, a trivial equirectanguar projection will be used. The following other projections are available:

*  `kav`: Kavrayskiy VII
*  `lam`: Lambert cylindrical equal-area

`-b`: Draw a border around the projected world. This can be useful for some projections.

`-c n`: Set to n colors. Accepts 0 or 8. Default is 256.

`-o`: Draw land masses as filled polygons. You'll get garbled results when using this together with country borders.

`-W path`: Instead of creating ASCII output, you can save the resulting image as an "uninterpreted" PNG file. You will want to use `-w` and `-h` together with this option.
